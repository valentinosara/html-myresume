    <h3><li>Sales Manager:</h3>
             <p>
                I worked as a sales manager for 3 weeks.
             <br />
               It was a very hard work, not because the sales, I did my job very well. 
               It was because I had to learn how to treat with people who don't now anything of sales, 
               and the most important thing i learned is to be a patient person.
